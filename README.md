# Cron-Job-API

This is a Back-End project for creating Cron Job API that processes
Subscription Payment. This API runs every 24 hours to process user subscription payments based on the userâ€™s status. It Checks for users whose trial plans have expired (planEndDate is in the past). If a user's status is active, the API charges them $97 using Authorize.net sdk. Payment details (card number, CVC, expiry date) are stored in the user schema. Besides, it logs the payment success or failure and updates the subscription status accordingly.



**The stacks and tools used in this project are described below:**
- Node.js + Express.js + Mongoose
